# Predicting Player Skill Levels in Online Games Using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to classify players in online games into skill categories: Beginner, Intermediate, or Professional. The classification is based on behavioral features such as playtime hours, session frequency, average session duration, player level, and in-game achievements.

The project aligns with the goals of Saudi Vision 2030 by demonstrating how artificial intelligence can be used for talent discovery in the e-sports and gaming industry. By analyzing player behavior, the system can help identify high-potential players and support future programs aimed at digital skills development.

## Models Used

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Linear Regression (used for evaluation only, not for classification)
